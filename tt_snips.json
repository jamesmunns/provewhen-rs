        "ï»¿The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us",
        "The fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses",
        "And he put it to us in this way--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity",
        "'Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?' said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair",
        "'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and--Duration",
        "But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact",
        "There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time",
        "'That,' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp; 'that",
        "'Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,' continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness",
        "'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it",
        "There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it",
        "You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?'I have not,' said the Provincial Mayor",
        "Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago",
        "See?'I think so,' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words",
        "'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time",
        "For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on",
        "All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing",
        "'Scientific people,' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this, 'know very well that Time is only a kind of Space",
        "Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here",
        "'Are you sure we can move freely in Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so",
        "'But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement",
        "Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave",
        "For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say",
        "Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground",
        "Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine--'To travel through Time!' exclaimed the Very Young Man",
        "'One might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!'Don't you think you would attract attention?' said the Medical Man",
        "'Just think! One might invest all one's money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!'To discover a society,' said I, 'erected on a strictly communistic basis",
        "'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--'Experimental verification!' cried I",
        "Then, still smiling faintly, and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory",
        "The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made",
        "And now I must be explicit, for this that follows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely unaccountable thing",
        "He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug",
        "The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model",
        "There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated",
        "I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace",
        "The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left",
        "It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions",
        "'This little affair,' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, 'is only a model",
        "You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way unreal",
        "' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual's hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger",
        "So that it was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its interminable voyage",
        "Then, getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to fill his pipe",
        "(The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut",
        ") 'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there'--he indicated the laboratory--'and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on my own account",
        "'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must have travelled through this time",
        "We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air",
        "And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory",
        "The thing was generally complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it",
        "Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller's words, we should have shown him far less scepticism",
        "He said he had seen a similar thing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out of the candle",
        "The next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of the Time Traveller's most constant guests--and, arriving late, found four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room",
        "The Medical Man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other",
        "'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,' said the Editor of a well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell",
        "The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner",
        "There was some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller's absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit",
        "The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the 'ingenious paradox and trick' we had witnessed that day week",
        "He was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise",
        "His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded",
        "His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense suffering",
        "He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face",
        "His glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room",
        "Again I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out",
        "Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines",
        "The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner--for a hot plate",
        "Conversation was exclamatory for a little while, with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity",
        "'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?' he inquired",
        "'I feel assured it's this business of the Time Machine,' I said, and took up the Psychologist's account of our previous meeting",
        "'What was this time travelling? A man couldn't cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?' And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature",
        "Hadn't they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing",
        "'Our Special Correspondent in the Day after To-morrow reports,' the Journalist was saying--or rather shouting--when the Time Traveller came back",
        "He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me",
        "'Have you been time travelling?'Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head",
        "The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine",
        "For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others",
        "The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness",
        "'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?' he said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests",
        "I will,' he went on, 'tell you the story of what has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions",
        "such days as no human being ever lived before! I'm nearly worn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this thing over to you",
        "In writing it down I feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my own inadequacy--to express its quality",
        "You read, I will suppose, attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker's white, sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation of his voice",
        "III   'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop",
        "There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it's sound enough",
        "I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle",
        "I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then",
        "I took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately the second",
        "I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before",
        "I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket",
        "There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash",
        "The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day",
        "I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things",
        "Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars",
        "I was still on the hill-side upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim",
        "I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away",
        "But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity",
        "But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread--until at last they took complete possession of me",
        "'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied",
        "The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve",
        "Like an impatient fool, I lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was flung headlong through the air",
        "A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine",
        "The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke",
        "A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour",
        "It was of white marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover",
        "It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips",
        "At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun",
        "'I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me",
        "'Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm",
        "Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness",
        "The great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses",
        "I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine",
        "In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes",
        "One of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I stood with my machine",
        "He was a slight creature--perhaps four feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt",
        "Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish which--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare",
        "His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much",
        "IV   'In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing out of futurity",
        "Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue",
        "'There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me",
        "Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease",
        "And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-pins",
        "But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine",
        "'And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness",
        "Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute",
        "The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on my part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them",
        "'As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation",
        "At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder",
        "The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me",
        "You see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art, everything",
        "'I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them",
        "Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck",
        "The idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom",
        "You who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created",
        "As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible merriment, to my mind",
        "I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious",
        "My general impression of the world I saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden",
        "I saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals",
        "They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time",
        "The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light",
        "Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised perhaps a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits",
        "Some I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they were strange",
        "With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round openings in the sides of the tables",
        "The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust",
        "These people of the remote future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also",
        "Indeed, I found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the Ichthyosaurus into extinction",
        "But the fruits were very delightful; one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was there--a floury thing in a three-sided husk--was especially good, and I made it my staple",
        "At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their import",
        "So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine",
        "The fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures",
        "At first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name",
        "They had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of amusement",
        "And very little doses I found they were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued",
        "They would come to me with eager cries of astonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stop examining me and wander away after some other toy",
        "The dinner and my conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone",
        "'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun",
        "The big building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present position",
        "I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One A",
        "'As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the world--for ruinous it was",
        "It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not determine",
        "It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience--the first intimation of a still stranger discovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place",
        "'Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested for a while, I realized that there were no small houses to be seen",
        "Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features of our own English landscape, had disappeared",
        "Then, in a flash, I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb",
        "In costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other, these people of the future were alike",
        "I judged, then, that the children of that time were extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion",
        "'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola",
        "I thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed the thread of my speculations",
        "There were no large buildings towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time",
        "The sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson",
        "I have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied",
        "Here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk",
        "There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden",
        "'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was something in this way",
        "For the first time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged",
        "The work of ameliorating the conditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life more and more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax",
        "And the harvest was what I saw!  'After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still in the rudimentary stage",
        "The science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease, but even so, it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently",
        "Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can",
        "We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands",
        "The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature",
        "In the end, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs",
        "'This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done indeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had leaped",
        "The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither",
        "And I shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes",
        "I saw mankind housed in splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them engaged in no toil",
        "The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone",
        "The difficulty of increasing population had been met, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase",
        "'I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of Nature",
        "Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived",
        "'Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that restless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness",
        "Even in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to survival, are a constant source of failure",
        "Physical courage and the love of battle, for instance, are no great help--may even be hindrances--to a civilized man",
        "And in a state of physical balance and security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of place",
        "For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil",
        "For such a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak",
        "Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet",
        "This has ever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor and decay",
        "To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more",
        "Possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary",
        "The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night",
        "Then my eye travelled along to the figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter",
        "There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn",
        "The Time Machine was gone!  'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world",
        "Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin",
        "All the time I ran I was saying to myself: 'They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way",
        "All the time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach",
        "I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes",
        "I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby",
        "I ran round it furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair",
        "Above me towered the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising moon",
        "'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy",
        "That is what dismayed me: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my invention had vanished",
        "Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not have moved in time",
        "The attachment of the levers--I will show you the method later--prevented any one from tampering with it in that way when they were removed",
        "I remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer",
        "I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs",
        "'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping",
        "I have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match",
        "'Where is my Time Machine?' I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon them and shaking them up together",
        "When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear",
        "'Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people over in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out under the moonlight",
        "Then I slept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm",
        "'I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and despair",
        "I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by",
        "They all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me",
        "It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity",
        "I found a groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine",
        "There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth",
        "There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened from within",
        "'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me",
        "Suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is how she would look",
        "In three strides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx",
        "I thought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit, I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have been mistaken",
        "Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes",
        "The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it",
        "I could work at a problem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter",
        "If they mean to take your machine away, it's little good your wrecking their bronze panels, and if they don't, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it",
        "' Then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it",
        "It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze",
        "I was careful, however, to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing",
        "I made what progress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there",
        "Either I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs",
        "Their sentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions",
        "Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival",
        "Here and there water shone like silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so faded into the serenity of the sky",
        "A peculiar feature, which presently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth",
        "Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain",
        "Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection with a lighted match",
        "But in all of them I heard a certain sound: a thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of air set down the shafts",
        "Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight",
        "Putting things together, I reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose true import it was difficult to imagine",
        "'And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in this real future",
        "In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and social arrangements, and so forth",
        "But while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one's imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as I found here",
        "'In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs",
        "But it occurred to me that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere beyond the range of my explorings",
        "This, again, was a question I deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point",
        "The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among this people there were none",
        "'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure",
        "The several big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and sleeping apartments",
        "Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork",
        "They spent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping",
        "'Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx",
        "It happened that, as I was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream",
        "When I realized this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land",
        "A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her",
        "Then I tried talk, and found that her name was Weena, which, though I don't know what it meant, somehow seemed appropriate enough",
        "That was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you!  'She was exactly like a child",
        "She tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively",
        "Yet her distress when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion",
        "She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them",
        "I discovered then, among other things, that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and slept in droves",
        "Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of Weena's distress I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes",
        "I had been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps",
        "I woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber",
        "It was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal",
        "'The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light",
        "Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body",
        "'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the view keenly",
        "If each generation die and leave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them",
        "On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once",
        "But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the morning, until Weena's rescue drove them out of my head",
        "I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine",
        "But people, unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body",
        "As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate",
        "A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness",
        "I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space behind me",
        "It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry",
        "'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back",
        "I could not find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed by a fallen pillar",
        "Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated",
        "It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft",
        "Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had disappeared",
        "It was not for some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I had seen was human",
        "And withal I was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful Upper-world people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow",
        "But my mind was already in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment",
        "There were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a long-continued underground habit",
        "In the first place, there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance",
        "Then, those large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of nocturnal things--witness the owl and the cat",
        "'Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race",
        "The presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, in fact, except along the river valley--showed how universal were its ramifications",
        "I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth",
        "No doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way",
        "Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky",
        "Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears",
        "Instead, I saw a real aristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of to-day",
        "Its triumph had not been simply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man",
        "But even on this supposition the balanced civilization that was at last attained must have long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay",
        "The too-perfect security of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and intelligence",
        "When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena's eyes",
        "VI   'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way",
        "They were just the half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum",
        "Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate",
        "I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--that night Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence",
        "I felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these underground mysteries",
        "'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me further and further afield in my exploring expeditions",
        "But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded",
        "I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium",
        "She danced beside me to the well, but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely disconcerted",
        "'Good-bye, little Weena,' I said, kissing her; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks",
        "Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement",
        "And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath",
        "Though my arms and back were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible",
        "Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible, while little Weena's head showed as a round black projection",
        "Everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had disappeared",
        "At last, with intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a slender loophole in the wall",
        "Swinging myself in, I found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and rest",
        "I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light",
        "But, so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion",
        "But I said to myself, 'You are in for it now,' and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of machinery grow louder",
        "Great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare",
        "The place, by the by, was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly shed blood was in the air",
        "The Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw",
        "When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances",
        "I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough matches",
        "If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure",
        "But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still remained to me",
        "'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store of matches had run low",
        "It had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to whom fire was a novelty",
        "Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour",
        "I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing",
        "The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness",
        "This time they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me",
        "I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel",
        "But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me",
        "'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back",
        "You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment",
        "But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third",
        "Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward",
        "At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight",
        "Hitherto, except during my night's anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries",
        "Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it",
        "And I now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for the dark",
        "The Upper-world people might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away",
        "The two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship",
        "They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable",
        "And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service",
        "They did it as a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism",
        "Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine",
        "And now that brother was coming back changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew",
        "It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside",
        "'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted",
        "I came out of this age of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors",
        "With that refuge as a base, I could face this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed",
        "'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible",
        "All the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be",
        "In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors--so that I was lame",
        "And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky",
        "My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase for floral decoration",
        "'  The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table",
        "'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone",
        "But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear",
        "You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees",
        "I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark",
        "In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war",
        "And why had they taken my Time Machine?  'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night",
        "Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder",
        "So we went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I almost walked into a little river",
        "This I waded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure, minus the head",
        "So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come",
        "Feeling tired--my feet, in particular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf",
        "Even were there no other lurking danger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose upon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-boles to strike against",
        "'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill",
        "The hill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things",
        "All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings",
        "Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius",
        "And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend",
        "'Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life",
        "I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future",
        "Instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went in terror",
        "Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be",
        "Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought",
        "'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion",
        "Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and white",
        "And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm",
        "I stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes, and flung them away",
        "'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding",
        "We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night",
        "I felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity",
        "Even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey",
        "After all, they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago",
        "Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed upon--probably saw to the breeding of",
        "And there was Weena dancing at my side!  'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness",
        "Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to him",
        "However great their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their Fear",
        "My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive",
        "In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks",
        "I had a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape",
        "And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling",
        "VIII   'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about noon, deserted and falling into ruin",
        "Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework",
        "It lay very high upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been",
        "I thought then--though I never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or might be happening, to the living things in the sea",
        "'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown character",
        "I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head",
        "She always seemed to me, I fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human",
        "'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we found, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows",
        "The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering",
        "Then I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton",
        "I recognized by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium",
        "The skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn away",
        "Going towards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time",
        "Here and there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds",
        "Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me",
        "'And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it presented",
        "This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder",
        "As for the rest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest",
        "I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered",
        "Apparently this section had been devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of recognition",
        "Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which I entered",
        "At intervals white globes hung from the ceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit",
        "Here I was more in my element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still fairly complete",
        "I fancied that if I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the Morlocks",
        "Had it not been for her I do not think I should have noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all",
        "[Footnote: It may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was built into the side of a hill",
        "As you went down the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit like the 'area' of a London house before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top",
        "I went slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until Weena's increasing apprehensions drew my attention",
        "I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even",
        "I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire",
        "And then down in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had heard down the well",
        "Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal-box",
        "Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways",
        "Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one's own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things",
        "'Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags",
        "The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books",
        "But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified",
        "At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly of the Philosophical Transactions and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics",
        "'Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry",
        "In part it was a modest cancan, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original",
        "'Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was a most fortunate thing",
        "In the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries",
        "It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions of years ago",
        "I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in fact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket",
        "I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword",
        "One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens",
        "In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think",
        "And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly took my fancy",
        "I went through gallery after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher",
        "I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came",
        "I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed",
        "It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire",
        "They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work",
        "I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey",
        "My plan was to go as far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the protection of its glare",
        "Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such litter",
        "Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward",
        "'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures",
        "Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down",
        "I was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat",
        "'I don't know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate",
        "The sun's heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts",
        "Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame",
        "The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to Weena",
        "It was very black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems",
        "Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there",
        "'For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet, the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of the blood-vessels in my ears",
        "The pattering grew more distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard in the Under-world",
        "I did so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks",
        "I hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane",
        "I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her",
        "The wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company!  'She seemed to have fainted",
        "I put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization",
        "In manoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path",
        "I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves",
        "I lit a match, and as I did so, two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away",
        "One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist",
        "Presently I noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen",
        "So, instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging down branches",
        "Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again",
        "I struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be",
        "As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches, and vanish",
        "And at that I understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks' flight",
        "'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest",
        "The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection",
        "Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left",
        "Beyond this was another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of fire",
        "Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment",
        "At first I did not realize their blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more",
        "'Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him",
        "At one time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me",
        "I was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand",
        "The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another universe, shone the little stars",
        "Two or three Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did so",
        "I beat the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here and there, and again sat down",
        "I cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined",
        "As I thought of that, I was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I contained myself",
        "From its summit I could now make out through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx",
        "I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena",
        "I began to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain",
        "X   'About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival",
        "I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence",
        "Here was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its fertile banks",
        "Some were bathing in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain",
        "It had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes--to come to this at last",
        "No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved",
        "'It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble",
        "'So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness, and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry",
        "Apparently as time went on, the feeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, had become disjointed",
        "Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years, came back again, and she began below",
        "So I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One",
        "'After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant",
        "Catching myself at that, I took my own hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and refreshing sleep",
        "I now felt safe against being caught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down the hill towards the White Sphinx",
        "So here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the White Sphinx, was a meek surrender",
        "Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze frame and up to the Time Machine",
        "I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose",
        "'Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened",
        "I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine",
        "Then I had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted",
        "As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock's skull ring--to recover it",
        "For an indefinite time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to find where I had arrived",
        "One dial records days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions",
        "The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through centuries",
        "At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky",
        "The band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set--it simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more red",
        "At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction",
        "At one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat",
        "I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done",
        "The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the earth",
        "Slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale",
        "North-eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars",
        "Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless",
        "It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight",
        "Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living",
        "And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt--pink under the lurid sky",
        "The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now",
        "'Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond",
        "The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine",
        "Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me",
        "'As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there",
        "I tried to brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost immediately came another by my ear",
        "With a frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me",
        "Its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending upon me",
        "Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green",
        "At last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens",
        "Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless",
        "To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white",
        "There were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen",
        "I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock",
        "'Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve",
        "For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that an eclipse was beginning",
        "Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth",
        "'The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number",
        "All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background of our lives--all that was over",
        "As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense",
        "At last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness",
        "As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing--against the red water of the sea",
        "But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle",
        "I began to recognize our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower",
        "The door at the lower end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered",
        "'Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them",
        "That gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine",
        "Presently I got up and came through the passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and feeling sorely begrimed",
        "I found the date was indeed to-day, and looking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o'clock",
        "To me the one incredible thing is that I am here to-night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures",
        "And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?'  He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap with it nervously upon the bars of the grate",
        "'What a pity it is you're not a writer of stories!' he said, putting his hand on the Time Traveller's shoulder",
        "Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles",
        "'It's a curious thing,' said the Medical Man; 'but I certainly don't know the natural order of these flowers",
        "Did I ever make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at times--but I can't stand another that won't fit",
        "If there is one!'  He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the door into the corridor",
        "There in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz",
        "Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry",
        "The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely",
        "Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle",
        "If you'll forgive my leaving you now?'  I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words, and he nodded and went on down the corridor",
        "What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the publisher, at two",
        "As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud",
        "A gust of air whirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor",
        "I knew that something strange had happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be",
        "At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him",
        "He may even now--if I may use the phrase--be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age",
        "But to me the future is still black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story"
